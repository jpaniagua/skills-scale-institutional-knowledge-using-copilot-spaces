# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates the retrospective session and ensures all voices are heard
- **Include all relevant roles**: Developers, PM, PdM, QA, and supporting roles (UX Designer, DevOps Engineer, Security Lead, etc.) as applicable
- **UX Designer**: Shares insights on user experience challenges and wins
- **Technical Writer**: Highlights documentation gaps or improvements
- **DevOps Engineer**: Reviews deployment and infrastructure lessons
- **Security Lead**: Discusses security practices and improvements

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
- **Scrum Master**: Tracks action items and ensures follow-through
- **Business Analyst**: Helps quantify improvement impact where applicable
