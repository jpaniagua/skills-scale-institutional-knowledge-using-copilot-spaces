# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
   - **Business Analyst**: Facilitates requirements gathering and documents detailed specifications
   - **UX Designer**: Presents initial design concepts and user research findings
   - **Security Lead**: Reviews security requirements and threat landscape
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
   - **Business Analyst**: Ensures acceptance criteria are clear and testable
   - **Technical Writer**: Reviews acceptance criteria language for clarity
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
   - **Scrum Master**: Facilitates estimation sessions and ensures team consensus
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
   - **Technical Writer**: Ensures documentation requirements are included
   - **Security Lead**: Adds security review checkpoints
   - **DevOps Engineer**: Includes deployment and infrastructure criteria
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
   - **DevOps Engineer**: Identifies infrastructure and pipeline dependencies
   - **Business Analyst**: Maps business process dependencies
6. Create release plan and milestone map
   - **UX Designer**: Aligns design deliverables with milestones
   - **Technical Writer**: Plans documentation releases with feature milestones

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates sprint planning and ensures proper story sizing
- **UX Designer**: Confirms design assets are ready for implementation
- **DevOps Engineer**: Validates infrastructure readiness for planned features

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
